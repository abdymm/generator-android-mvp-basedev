## What is this ?

This is a generator ecosystem by [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/authoring/index.html) thank helps us to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive  and of course make our life is easier.

In this repository I create generator for android development, actually this is my android base development. 
I built this android dev template with offline first approach [Google IO 2016] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70WqJxymPr8&t=2s) and inspired by this [Android Architecture] (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture) and this [Android Job Queue] (https://github.com/yigit/android-priority-jobqueue).
The Stack :
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) //asdfasdf
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
- [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber)
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)
- [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler)
- [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus)
- [Job-Queue](https://github.com/yigit/android-priority-jobqueue)
- [Android-Db-Debug](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/Android-Debug-Database)
- [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary)
- [DBFlow](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow)


## How it works

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-android-mvp-basedev using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-android-mvp-basedev
```

Then generate your new project:
